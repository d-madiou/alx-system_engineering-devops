Infrastructure Specifics

What is a Server? A computer or system providing resources/services to clients over a network. Here, it hosts the website at IP 8.8.8.8.
Role of Domain Name: foobar.com provides a human-readable address resolved to IP 8.8.8.8 via DNS.
Type of DNS Record for www: An 'A' (Address) record maps www.foobar.com to 8.8.8.8.
Role of Web Server (Nginx): Handles HTTP requests, serves static content, and proxies dynamic requests.
Role of Application Server: Processes dynamic content and interacts with the database.
Role of Database (MySQL): Stores and manages website data like user info or settings.
Communication Protocol: The server uses HTTP/HTTPS over TCP/IP to communicate with the user's browser.

Issues with This Infrastructure

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server fails, the website becomes inaccessible with no backup.
Downtime During Maintenance: Deploying new code or restarting services causes downtime as everything runs on one server.
Scaling Limitations: High traffic can overwhelm the server with no load balancing or additional servers to distribute load.

FLow of the design
A user types www.foobar.com in their browser. The DNS server resolves the domain to the server's IP (8.8.8.8). The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, where Nginx (web server) handles the request, forwards dynamic content processing to the application server, which interacts with MySQL (database) if needed, using the application files (codebase). The response is sent back to the user.
